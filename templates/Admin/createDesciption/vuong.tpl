{gt text="The Vuong- Routine chooses a voluntary acolyte for every worship at first. If there isn't any voluntary acolyte it chooses an other acolyte by a random routine. After chosing an acolyte it tests, if the acolyte is not devided in the last 4 days or the last 4 worships. The random routine selects the acolyte having the lowest unber of devidings. <br/>
After that it looks, if there is a prtner. If the partner can't ministrate at this worship, both (partner and acolyte) are removed. If the partner is too for this worship and partner order is longer than two, the partner will be not devided (This works, if the partner state is 'have to', too). otherwise they both won't be devided, too. If there isn't anything of this, the partner will devided. <br/> 
The routine don't deals with devidings to churches or dates.}
